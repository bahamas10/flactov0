Flac to mp3 v0 converter script

This script was created to make it easy to convert flac files
to mp3 v0 files over the command line.  Its usage mimics that of
cp, by allow 1 or many source files, and a destination.

If 2 or more source files are found, the destination argument must
be a directory.  If one source file is given, the second argument
will be used as the name of the output file, unless it is a directory,
in which case the output file will be the same as the input with the
original extension stripped and the flac extension used.
